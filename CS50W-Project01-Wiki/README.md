# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


## Overview
This is a book review website. Users are able to register and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. A third-party API by Goodreads is used to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via websiteâ€™s API.
